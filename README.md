#fileUploadphp description:

    This is my code for uploading a single file in php.  I am currently working on 
    uploading using more than one input forms.  I have attempted to do more than one
    input from this file, but to no avail.  I shall attempt that in another php file.  
    This Php upload only accepts png files less than 3MB.  That can be modified to whatever file type by changing up the code a bit.  
    Thanks to newboston for the headstart on this mini project.  This code will be used in the rnaSeq portal project.
    
    Version 2 on 2/20/16:
    Got two file uploads of different file types to work.  
    The issue with my previous attempt one was the order of the defined variables which yielded an undefined index error.  
    So the php code for the variables and function now comes before the method calling the function.
